                    R150 Class booking fees. This is non-refundable and if you do not pitch up for the class or let us know 24 hours before the time that you will not be attending the class, you will need to pay another R100 for another booking.

                    In order for you to get to the next level, you will need to do the level just above it. E.g. If you need a grade C certificate as you wish to become an Armed Response Officer, you will need to do Grade E and achieve it in order to do Grade D. Once you have done the Grade D, then you can do Grade C. Once you have the Grade C, you can then apply for the Armed Response grading.

                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
                    The only thing to remember is that you do not have to do Armed Response in order to do B and A, but you must have C to do B and then B to do A.
